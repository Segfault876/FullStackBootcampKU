                My name is Nick Panagakis and I do development.
                I have class experience in web-related technologies such as Node.js and SQL, 
                as well as hobby-related experience in lower-level technologies such as C++ and SDL.

                When I'm not busy computing you may find me playing guitar or counting sheep.
